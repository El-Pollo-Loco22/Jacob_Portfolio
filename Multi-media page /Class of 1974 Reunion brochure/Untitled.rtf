\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 For the Charlotte Valley School Alumni Union, I designed a tri-fold reunion brochure that captured the nostalgia and spirit of the alumni community. The brochure featured a clean, elegant layout, incorporating the school colors and modern typography to blend past and present. My role included concept development, layout design, and ensuring print readiness. The final product provided alumni with event details and a schedule, This job strengthened my skills in creating cohesive designs that communicate effectively and resonate with their audience.}
