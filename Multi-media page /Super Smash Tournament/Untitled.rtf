\outl0\strokewidth0 \strokec2 I collaborated with an event planning group to develop a visual design for a local video game tournament aimed at boosting attendance at a neighborhood bar. The project encompassed creating promotional materials, event signage, and digital assets to ensure a dynamic and engaging experience for participants and spectators alike. A key feature of the campaign was a motion poster designed in a bold Y2K aesthetic, blending nostalgic early 2000s design trends with vibrant, high-energy visuals. This poster was optimized for both print and social media platforms, helping to generate excitement and drive event awareness.}
